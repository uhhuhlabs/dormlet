Examples:

git commit -m "CHG change button colour"
git commit -m "RM redundant comments"
git commit -m "ADD button for something"
```


## Issue Guidelines

If you are reporting a bug or some other issue then please provide steps to reproduce the issue you faced. 

If you are developing, then providing your environment will be quite helpful (operating system, debug environment, etc.). Screenshots are very helpful.

Please make sure your issue title starts with an all caps [descriptive prefixes](#descriptive-prefixes) from above. Failure to do so will lead to the automatic closure of your issue.
